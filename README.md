# SVAD - Simple Voice Activation Detector

This simple voice activation detector compares a microphone input with given sample files and tries to find a pattern. For that it cuts everything in chunks according to the setted buffer, converts every dataset value to an absolute float and sums it. With the help of the eucledean distance the script tries to find enough matches within the chunks.

# Maintaining & Contribution

Since this project is part of an exam for my studies in computer science I consider this as finished. I will not maintain this repository. If you want to contribute, you can as long as you follow the licence agreement.
